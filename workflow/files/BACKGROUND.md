# Background

The stratification files were developed with the Global Alliance for Genomic
Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team, the [Genome in a Bottle Consortium
(GIAB)](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle) and the
[Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium
(T2T)](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup). They are intended as
a standard resource of BED files for use in stratifying true positive, false
positive and false negative variant calls in challenging and targeted regions of
the the genome.

The stratification BED files are only accessible on the [GIAB FTP
site](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/).
These files can be used as a standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH
benchmark tools such as [hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py).
