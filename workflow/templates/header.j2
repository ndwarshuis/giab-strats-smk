# Stratification Summary

Mappability BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium.

These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH
benchmarking tools such as [hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py) to
stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative va riant calls based
on genomic region short read mappability.
