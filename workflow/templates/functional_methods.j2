## Description of methods used to generate the stratifications

A GFF file containing the CDS regions (and likely other stuff) is filtered for
lines with "(Best)RefSeq" and "CDS" (in columns 2 and 3 respectively). This is
then parsed into a bed file by subsetting to columns 1, 4, and 5 (chrom, start,
and end respectively) and shifting each coordinate by -1 (note that GFF files
are 1-based and BED files are 0-based). Coordinates where start == end are
removed. The remainining regions are merged using `mergeBed`.
