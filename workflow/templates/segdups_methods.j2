## Processing

Segdups up to 100 base pairs apart were merged with `mergeBed` using `-d 100`.
This became the "segmental duplications" file described above. The "long"
segmental duplications bed was created by filtering the previous bed with `awk`
for regions > 10000 base pairs (`end` - `start`).

The above two bed files were then complemented as-is using `complementBed`.
